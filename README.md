Credit Card Validator

This Java program validates a credit card number by implementing a custom algorithm. The validation process includes:

1. Removing the last digit as a check digit.
2. Reversing the remaining digits.
3. Doubling every second digit (starting from the reversed list's first element) and adjusting if results are double-digits.
4. Summing all digits, calculating a check digit, and comparing it with the original last digit to determine validity.

Run the program by entering a credit card number when prompted. The program will output whether the card is valid or invalid.
